# Spam Email Classifier

This project is a **Spam Email Classifier** built using machine learning techniques. It classifies emails as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam) based on the content of the email. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails and uses techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a spam email classifier using machine learning. The model is trained on a collection of emails labeled as "spam" or "ham." It uses text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, followed by the extraction of relevant features (like term frequency) to train a classifier such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Processing)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for experimentation and prototyping)

## Installation

To get started with the Spam Email Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spam-email-classifier
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled email data with the classes **spam** and **ham**. You can use the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/) or any other similar dataset for training.

Make sure to place the dataset file (usually in CSV or text format) in the project folder, and update the script to reflect the correct path to the dataset file.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing the Text Data**: 
   The text data needs to be preprocessed before it can be fed into a machine learning model. This step involves:
   - Lowercasing all text
   - Tokenizing the text (breaking it into individual words)
   - Removing stopwords (common words such as 'the', 'a', etc. that do not add meaningful information)
   - Stemming (reducing words to their root form)

2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   Use techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorizer** to convert the text data into numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

3. **Training the Model**: 
   Train a classification model like **Naive Bayes** or **SVM** to classify the emails based on their content.

4. **Predicting**: 
   Use the trained model to predict if a new email is spam or ham.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
# Assuming the dataset is in a CSV file with 'text' and 'label' columns
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('emails.csv')

# Preprocessing
# Tokenize, remove stopwords, and perform stemming (you can use NLTK or similar libraries)

# Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['text'])
y = df['label']

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Naive Bayes model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Model Training

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenize and clean the text data using `NLTK`.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Selection**: We use **Multinomial Naive Bayes** or any other suitable algorithm.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

After training the model, you should evaluate the results by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in the test set. This will give you the performance of your model. The output might look like this:

```
Accuracy: 97.5%
```

You can visualize the results using confusion matrices or classification reports:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.show()

# Classification Report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
